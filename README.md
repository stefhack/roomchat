roomchat
========
Here is a personnal project using Node.js and socket.io in order to build a simple chat.
For the moment, you can just enter a nickname, choose a color with a color-picker and begin to chat with friends.
You are advised when somedody enter and exit the chat.

I decided to add a funny feature : you can draw with mouse or your finger on a touchscreen and friends you talk with will 
see exactly the same.

In the future, i will improve the User Interface of course and i will add the possibility to create rooms.
